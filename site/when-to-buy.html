            <span class="section-label">The Short Answer</span>
            <h2>The Answer Is Always Now</h2>
            <p>If you've been wondering when the right time is to get life insurance, the answer is simple: today. Whether you're 25 or 55, single or married, healthy or managing a condition, there has never been a better time to secure coverage than right now. The younger and healthier you are, the less you'll pay, but no matter your situation, there's a policy that fits.</p>
            <p>Life insurance isn't just about death. It's about protecting the people you love from financial hardship, covering debts, replacing income, and leaving a legacy. The sooner you act, the more options you have and the less it costs.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">Why Waiting Costs You More</h2>
            <p>Every year you delay getting life insurance, you're betting against yourself. Here's why waiting is one of the most expensive financial mistakes you can make.</p>

            <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-trend-up me-2" style="font-size: 1rem; opacity: 0.5;"></i>Premiums Increase With Age</h3>
            <p>Life insurance premiums are directly tied to your age at the time of application. A healthy 25-year-old can lock in a $500,000 term policy for as little as $15-20 per month. Wait until 35, and that same policy might cost $25-30. By 45, you could be looking at $50-70 or more. Every birthday that passes without coverage is money left on the table.</p>

            <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-heart-pulse me-2" style="font-size: 1rem; opacity: 0.5;"></i>Health Changes Are Unpredictable</h3>
            <p>You might feel invincible today, but health conditions can emerge without warning. A new diagnosis of high blood pressure, diabetes, or something more serious can dramatically increase your premiums or even make you uninsurable for certain products. Locking in coverage while you're healthy protects you against future uncertainty.</p>

            <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-bolt me-2" style="font-size: 1rem; opacity: 0.5;"></i>Life Events Don't Wait</h3>
            <p>Marriage, a new baby, buying a home, starting a business: these milestones create immediate financial obligations. If something were to happen to you before you secured coverage, your family could be left with a mortgage they can't pay, childcare they can't afford, or a business that folds. Life insurance should be in place before you need it, not after.</p>

                <h3>In Your 20s</h3>
                <p>This is when you're at your healthiest and can lock in the lowest premiums available. Even if you don't have dependents yet, life insurance in your 20s can cover student loans that your parents may have co-signed, protect a partner or spouse, and give you a financial foundation that grows with you. A term policy at this age can cost less than a streaming subscription.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>In Your 30s</h3>
                <p>This is the decade of big milestones: marriage, kids, and homeownership. Your financial obligations are growing rapidly, and your family is depending on your income. Life insurance in your 30s ensures your mortgage gets paid, your children are cared for, and your spouse isn't left scrambling. Premiums are still very affordable at this stage, making it the sweet spot for coverage.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>In Your 40s</h3>
                <p>You're likely in your peak earning years with kids approaching college age. The financial stakes are higher than ever. Life insurance protects the income your family relies on, helps fund education plans, and can serve as a key part of your long-term financial strategy. If you don't already have coverage, this is a critical time to act before premiums climb further.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>In Your 50s</h3>
                <p>Retirement is on the horizon, and estate planning becomes a priority. Life insurance at this stage can supplement your retirement income through cash value policies, protect your spouse's lifestyle if you pass first, and help cover estate taxes or leave an inheritance. Whole life and IUL products are particularly valuable in this decade.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>In Your 60s and Beyond</h3>
                <p>Final expense insurance becomes especially important, ensuring your funeral costs and remaining debts don't burden your children. Life insurance can also protect a surviving spouse's income, preserve an inheritance for grandchildren, and cover any outstanding medical expenses. Simplified-issue and guaranteed-acceptance products make coverage accessible regardless of health status.</p>

            <span class="section-label">Myths vs. Reality</span>
            <h2>Common Reasons People Delay</h2>
            <p>I hear the same objections from people every day. Here's why none of them hold up under scrutiny.</p>

            <h3>"I'm Young and Healthy — I Don't Need It Yet"</h3>
            <p>That's exactly why you should get it now. Your youth and health are your greatest assets when it comes to life insurance pricing. The longer you wait, the more you'll pay. Locking in a policy today means you'll enjoy the lowest rates possible for the entire duration of your coverage. And if your health changes down the road, you're already protected.</p>

            <h3>"I Can't Afford It Right Now"</h3>
            <p>Life insurance is far more affordable than most people think. A healthy 30-year-old can get $500,000 in term coverage for under $25 per month. That's less than most people spend on coffee each week. And the real question isn't whether you can afford life insurance. It's whether your family can afford to go without it.</p>

            <h3>"I'll Deal With It Later"</h3>
            <p>Later is one of the most dangerous words in financial planning. Every year you wait, premiums increase. Every year you wait, the chance of a health change grows. And unfortunately, accidents and unexpected diagnoses don't send advance notice. The best time to deal with it was yesterday. The second-best time is today.</p>

            <h3>"I Don't Have Dependents"</h3>
            <p>Even without a spouse or children, life insurance has value. If you have co-signed student loans, aging parents who may depend on you, or a business partner, coverage protects those relationships. And if you lock in a policy now, you'll have coverage in place when you do start a family, at a fraction of the future cost.</p>

            <div class="notice-bar">
                <p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> There is no wrong time to get life insurance, but there is a wrong time to realize you waited too long. Every day without coverage is a gamble with your family's financial future. Let's make sure that doesn't happen.</p>
