            <h2>Agreement to Terms</h2>
            <p>By accessing or using the website operated by Mitch Van Dusen Insurance ("we," "us," or "our") at vandusenlifeinsurance.com, or by engaging with our insurance brokerage services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use our website or services.</p>
            <p>These Terms of Service apply to all visitors, users, clients, and anyone who accesses or uses our website or services in any capacity. We reserve the right to update or modify these terms at any time, and your continued use of the website or services after such changes constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

            <!-- Description of Services -->
            <h2>Description of Services</h2>
            <p>Mitch Van Dusen Insurance operates as a licensed, independent life insurance brokerage. We help individuals and families evaluate, compare, and obtain life insurance coverage from a variety of third-party insurance carriers.</p>

            <div class="notice-bar">
                <p><strong style="color: white;">Important:</strong> We are an insurance brokerage, not an insurance company. We do not underwrite, issue, or administer insurance policies. All insurance products are provided by third-party insurance carriers. Our role is to act as an intermediary — helping you find, compare, and apply for coverage that meets your needs.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Our services include, but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Free consultations to assess your life insurance needs</li>
                <li>Comparing quotes and coverage options across multiple carriers</li>
                <li>Assisting with the completion and submission of insurance applications</li>
                <li>Providing ongoing support and policy service after coverage is placed</li>
                <li>Educational guidance on life insurance products and options</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- No Guarantee of Coverage -->
            <h2>No Guarantee of Coverage</h2>
            <p>While we work diligently to help you find appropriate coverage, we cannot and do not guarantee that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You will be approved for any insurance policy</li>
                <li>A specific premium rate will be offered to you</li>
                <li>Coverage will be available for your particular circumstances</li>
                <li>Any particular carrier will accept your application</li>
                <li>The terms of a policy will remain unchanged after issuance</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All insurance coverage is subject to the underwriting guidelines, approval processes, and terms and conditions of the issuing insurance carrier. Final decisions on coverage, premiums, and policy terms are made solely by the insurance carrier, not by Mitch Van Dusen Insurance.</p>

            <!-- Accuracy of Information -->
