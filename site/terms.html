            <h2>Agreement to Terms</h2>
            <p>By accessing or using the website operated by Mitch Van Dusen Insurance ("we," "us," or "our") at vandusenlifeinsurance.com, or by engaging with our insurance brokerage services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use our website or services.</p>
            <p>These Terms of Service apply to all visitors, users, clients, and anyone who accesses or uses our website or services in any capacity. We reserve the right to update or modify these terms at any time, and your continued use of the website or services after such changes constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

            <!-- Description of Services -->
            <h2>Description of Services</h2>
            <p>Mitch Van Dusen Insurance operates as a licensed, independent life insurance brokerage. We help individuals and families evaluate, compare, and obtain life insurance coverage from a variety of third-party insurance carriers.</p>

            <div class="notice-bar">
                <p><strong style="color: white;">Important:</strong> We are an insurance brokerage, not an insurance company. We do not underwrite, issue, or administer insurance policies. All insurance products are provided by third-party insurance carriers. Our role is to act as an intermediary — helping you find, compare, and apply for coverage that meets your needs.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Our services include, but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Free consultations to assess your life insurance needs</li>
                <li>Comparing quotes and coverage options across multiple carriers</li>
                <li>Assisting with the completion and submission of insurance applications</li>
                <li>Providing ongoing support and policy service after coverage is placed</li>
                <li>Educational guidance on life insurance products and options</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- No Guarantee of Coverage -->
            <h2>No Guarantee of Coverage</h2>
            <p>While we work diligently to help you find appropriate coverage, we cannot and do not guarantee that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You will be approved for any insurance policy</li>
                <li>A specific premium rate will be offered to you</li>
                <li>Coverage will be available for your particular circumstances</li>
                <li>Any particular carrier will accept your application</li>
                <li>The terms of a policy will remain unchanged after issuance</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All insurance coverage is subject to the underwriting guidelines, approval processes, and terms and conditions of the issuing insurance carrier. Final decisions on coverage, premiums, and policy terms are made solely by the insurance carrier, not by Mitch Van Dusen Insurance.</p>

            <!-- Accuracy of Information -->

            <p>You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information when using our website, submitting contact forms, scheduling consultations, or completing insurance applications.

            <h3>Scheduling Platforms</h3>

            <h2>SMS Messaging Terms & Conditions</h2>
            <p>These SMS Messaging Terms & Conditions ("SMS Terms") supplement the general Terms of Service above and specifically govern our use of Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), and text messaging communications (collectively, "SMS Messages") with you. By providing your mobile phone number to us (via website form, verbal consent, or otherwise) or by opting in to receive SMS Messages, you expressly agree to these SMS Terms, our general Terms of Service, and our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree, do not provide your phone number or opt in to SMS communications.</p>

            <h3>Description of SMS Use Cases</h3>
            <p>We may send you SMS Messages for the following purposes related to our life insurance brokerage services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Policy updates, renewals, status notifications, and important account information (e.g., "Your policy [Policy Number] is up for renewal on [Date]")</li>
                <li>Appointment scheduling, reminders, confirmations, rescheduling requests, and follow-up communications</li>
                <li>Promotional offers, educational content, quote reminders, coverage comparison alerts, and marketing messages related to life insurance products (e.g., term life, whole life, IUL, final expense)</li>
                <li>Customer service responses, two-way communications, and support inquiries (e.g., answering questions about quotes or applications)</li>
                <li>Compliance-related notices or confirmations of your opt-in/opt-out requests</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All SMS Messages are sent using automated systems and may include embedded links (e.g., to policy documents or scheduling tools) or phone numbers for callback. Messages are professional, relevant to insurance services, and comply with applicable laws including TCPA, CTIA guidelines, and A2P 10DLC requirements.</p>

            <h3>Message Frequency</h3>
            <p>Message frequency varies based on your needs and interactions. You may receive 1-4 messages per month on average, though this can be higher during active policy application, renewal periods, or if you engage in two-way communication. We do not send spam or unrelated content.</p>

            <h3>Opt-In and Consent</h3>
            <p>Consent to receive SMS Messages is not a condition of purchasing any goods or services. You provide prior express written consent when you: (1) submit your phone number via our website contact/quote form with an unchecked checkbox acknowledging these SMS Terms; (2) verbally provide consent; or (3) reply affirmatively to a confirmation message. We may use double opt-in (e.g., sending a confirmation text requiring "YES" reply) for added compliance.</p>

            <h3>Opt-Out Instructions</h3>
            <p>You may opt out of receiving SMS Messages at any time by replying "STOP", "UNSUBSCRIBE", "END", "QUIT", "CANCEL", or "OPT-OUT" to any message we send. After opting out, you will receive one final confirmation message stating you have been unsubscribed, and no further messages will be sent (except as required by law). Opt-out requests are processed immediately. If you experience issues, contact us via the details in the "Contact Us" section above.</p>

            <h3>Message & Data Rate Disclosure</h3>
            <p>Message and data rates may apply for each SMS Message sent or received, depending on your mobile carrier plan and rates. We do not charge you any additional fees for our SMS program, but standard messaging and data charges from your carrier may apply. Please consult your mobile carrier for details on applicable rates.</p>

            <h3>Help and Customer Support</h3>
            <p>For help or questions about our SMS program, reply "HELP" to any message, or contact us directly:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Phone/Text: 346-531-5256</li>
                <li>Email/Online: Use our <a href="contact.html">Contact Page</a></li>

            <h3>Age Restriction (18+)</h3>
            <p>Our SMS Messages pertain to life insurance and financial services, which are intended only for individuals 18 years of age or older. By opting in or providing your phone number, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old. We do not knowingly collect or send messages to individuals under 18. If we learn a recipient is under 18, we will immediately cease messaging and delete the number.</p>

            <h3>Carrier Liability Disclaimer</h3>
            <p>Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages. Participation in our SMS program is subject to carrier filtering, blocking, or other restrictions. We are not responsible for messages not delivered due to carrier actions, technical issues, or your device settings.</p>

            <h3>Additional Provisions</h3>
            <p>These SMS Terms are governed by the same law and jurisdiction as the general Terms of Service (Texas law, Harris County courts). We reserve the right to modify these SMS Terms at any time; continued receipt of messages after changes constitutes acceptance. For full privacy details (including how we handle your phone number), see our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated herein. We do not sell or share your phone number for unrelated marketing purposes.</p>
